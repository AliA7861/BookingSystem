# Room Booking System

This is an A-Level project that I created in C# to enable students to book different rooms for revision purposes through a simple GUI display. The system utilises SQL in order to record the details of users and the bookings made into a database.

# Functions:
- Users are required to make an account in order to make a booking.
- Students can specify particular bookings using filters such as the date, start and end time, and the specific room needed.
- Enables the user to make, update or delete reservations in the system.
- Data stored in a SQL database, helping to cross-reference bookings when viewing a current booking or checking if a room isn't being utilised by another student.
- A display that allows users to view current bookings to ensure bookings do not overlap.
- Admin users are able to view current bookings that have been made using the number of entries in the database.
- Admin users can produce various graphs/reports to represent data in different formats.
- The system will ensure the user has entered all the necessary fields in the registration system to ensure there are no null fields.
- Notifications on successful/failed bookings including indication of occupied rooms in the event of overlapped bookings.
- Verifies if the user has already made a booking for the same date and time, forcing the user to make necessary changes before submission.

This project can be used to provide inspiration and a guide for other projects, not for distributing or copying directly.
